# Procedgen

A laboratory for experimentation in procedurally generated
information, from signals to data structures. Currently, experiments
in this code base are focused on:

- sound
- music

Over time, there will be newer algorithms added for procedural
generation of:

- 2D images
- 3D scenes
- natural languages
- computer languages

This libary is intended to be used from a GHCI interactive session,
with a goal of making something useful for live coding demos. Graphics
are displayed in a Gtk+ window via the Happlets library.
